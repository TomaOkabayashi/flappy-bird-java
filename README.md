# Flappy-Bird-Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Java's Swing library for the graphical user interface.

## How to Run

To run the game, you need to compile the FlappyBirdFrame.java file and execute the generated class file. Here are the steps:

1. Have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on system.
2. Compile the FlappyBirdFrame.java file using the command:

`javac FlappyBirdFrame.java`

3. Execute the compiled class file:

`java FlappyBirdFrame`

## Game Instructions

- Press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
- Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.
- Each successful passage through the pipes earns you points.
- If the bird collides with the pipes or falls below the screen, the game ends.

## Gameplay Features

- Bird Movement: The bird automatically descends due to gravity. Pressing the spacebar makes it ascend.
- Pipe Generation: Pipes are randomly generated and move from right to left across the screen.
- Score Tracking: Earn points for each successful passage through the pipes.
- Game Over: The game ends if the bird collides with the pipes or falls below the screen.
- Restart: Press the spacebar to restart the game after it ends.

## Controls

- Spacebar: Make the bird flap its wings to ascend.
- Game Over: Press the spacebar to restart the game after it ends.

## Dependencies

- This project utilizes Java's Swing library for creating the game window and graphics.
- No external dependencies are required apart from the standard Java Development Kit (JDK).

## Context

One of the first projects I made for fun using youtube, especially for collisions. Comments are lacking however, remaking this was made much easier thanks to them.
